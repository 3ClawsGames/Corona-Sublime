##Corona SDK Bundle for Sublime Text 2

You can get more information about the original bundle here: http://www.ludicroussoftware.com/corona-textmate-bundle/

I forked that repository because this TextMate Bundle was not working on Sublime Text 2. I'll try to keep this as updated as possible, following ludicrous software updates. Let me know if you have any other problems.

**Instructions:**

type in the terminal:

*cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages*

and

*git clone git@github.com:drowne/Corona-SDK.tmbundle.git Corona*

**or download the last version [HERE] and uncompress it to the packages folder**
